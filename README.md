## Project Reuse.
The project is completely developed from scratch by Vinayak Sareen (me), so I give permission to reuse it in any context as a result. Feel free to fork the project and use it as it is or tweak it as per your requirements for the front-end portfolio. If you clone the project, I would appreciate a star on the respective repository. If there are any issues, feel free to contact me at contact@sareenv.com
